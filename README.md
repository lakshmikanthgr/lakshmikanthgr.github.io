# lakshmikanthgr.github.io

## Recent changes

- Homepage: added a polished dark hero, typing effect, and CTAs.
- Replaced avatar with `assets/images/star_bucks_chicago.jpg` across site.
- Site is now dark-mode only (HTML root set with `data-theme="dark").`
- Added a small JS file (`assets/js/main.js`) for typing, smooth-scroll, and reveal effects.

## Local preview

From the repository root run:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

If you want the theme toggle back or different avatar, edit the HTML files in the repo root and `assets/js/main.js`.
