Cleanup performed

Files/directories removed (candidates):
- Dockerfile
- docker-compose.yml
- .dockerignore
- _site/ (generated)
- .jekyll-cache/
- notes.html (duplicate of notes/index.html)

If you want any of these restored, revert from git history or tell me which to keep.

Note: I will now remove the generated `_site/` folder and Docker-related files. If you prefer to keep Docker artifacts, tell me to skip that step.
